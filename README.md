# Anniversary

An app to keep track of that special day.

## Motivation

Looking for a sweet way to surprise my girlfriend, and to learn Flutter, Anniversary App was born! The app is simple. The amount of:

* Years
* Months
* Days
* Hours
* Minutes

Are kept track of from your current time to that special date.

With love for you A. H.,

J. V. D.
